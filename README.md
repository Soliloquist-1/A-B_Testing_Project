# A-B_Testing_Project

For this project, I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. 
I made use of two datasets.

1. ab_data.csv, which contains the A/B test records of users both in control group and treatment group.
2. countries.csv, which takes which countries the users are from into consideration, and this part was explored in the latter half of the analysis
